  <h4><b>Bio</b></h4>
  <p>

      <!-- <br>I have been a Computer Scientist in Information Sciences Institute and a Research Assistant Professor in Department of Computer Science, at University of Southern California since Fall 2020.<br>
    I got my Ph.D degree in Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was working with Prof. <a href=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/ target="_blank">Eduard Hovy</a>.
    Before coming to CMU, I was a master student of Center for Brain-like Computing and Machine Intelligence (BCMI), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.
    I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was a member of <a href=http://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/ target="_blank">ACM Class</a>, now part of Zhiyuan College in SJTU. -->
    <br> I received my BE degree in computer science and technology from the University of Science and Technology of China and my MS degree in software engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where he is currently working toward a Ph.D. degree of computer science and technology,
     under the supervision of Prof. <a href=https://basics.sjtu.edu.cn/~liguoqiang>Guoqiang Li</a>. My research interests include natural language processing, knowledge graphs, and AI verification.

    <!-- I believe that representation learning techniques based on deep learning methods can fundamentally transform the conventional feature designing paradigm.
    Representation learning can, in principle, automatically learn representations that are mathematically and computationally convenient to process.
    Furthermore, beyond learning representations for specific tasks, representation learning allows us to identify and disentangle the underlying causal factors,
    to tease apart the underlying dependencies of the data, so that it becomes easier to understand, to classify, or to perform other tasks such as, even, controllable and interpretable data generation or manipulation.
    <b>My research focuses on fulfilling this transformation to enhance the <i>effectiveness, efficiency, interpretablility and robustness</i> of representation learning,
       by developing and analyzing deep learning techniques
    </b>.
    The key contributions of my research are as follows:
    <dl style="PADDING-LEFT: 40px">
    <dt><b>Robustness in interlingual representation learning</b></dt>
    <dd>We developed efficient neural architectures and learning algorithms to learn an univeral semantic space to represent the meaning of sentences in different languages.</dd>
    <dt><b>Representation learning via deep generative models</b></dt>
    <dd>We developed deep generative models to improve both data density estimation and latent representation learning for text and image data.</dd>
    <dt><b>Interpretable and robust systems via disentangled representation learning</b></dt>
    <dd>We enhance deep learning systems' interpretability and robustness by building models upon disentangled representations to tease apart underlying dependencies of data
      and connect output representations with input causal factors.</dd>
    <dt><b>Applications of representation learning techniques</b></dt>
    <dd>We apply (unsupervised and/or weakly-supervised) representation learning techniques, such as representation transfer learning, to NLP and CV tasks in different domains to advance the state-of-the-art and/or
      to reduce requirement of human annotated resources.</dd>
